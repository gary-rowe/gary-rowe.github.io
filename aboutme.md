# Developer
For the past 30 years I've been a professional developer in a variety of languages. I've worked in a wide variety of sectors including aviation, telecommunications, government, distributed ledger (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero etc), charity, financial and so on. 

While I'm able to design a reasonable user interface I much prefer to work on back end systems.

Some notable achievements as a developer are:

* Co-developer of the UK Met Office National Severe Weather Warning Service
* Providing consultancy to the board of HSBC Global on distributed ledger technology
* Co-developer of the [MultiBit Bitcoin wallet](https://github.com/Multibit-Legacy) (over 1.5 million downloads)
* Creator of the [`hid4java`](https://github.com/gary-rowe/hid4java) open source library
* Co-developer of low level code for the UK ISDN endpoints

# Director
I first became a director of a limited company way back in 1999 and have held several directorships since then across a variety of companies. In all these companies I have promoted the use of open source software wherever possible.

# Dad
I've been a father for many years. One purpose of this blog is to enable me to pass on a few bits of knowledge that I've picked up along the way that might just help out the next generation.

## Running
I'm a long distance runner. I've done a lot of half-marathon distances and a marathon but one day I hope to run an ultra-marathon. I prefer to run on trails which I think gives me a better overall workout than pounding the tarmac.

## Public Key
If you want to send me something securely, or want to verify that something came from me and nobody else, then you should [use public key `0x2183BCD259A81D7B`](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?search=0x2183BCD259A81D7B&fingerprint=on&op=index) with fingerprint of `59A81D7B`.

You should see this image with it:
